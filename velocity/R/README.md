Package: outbreakvelocity  
Title: Estimates front-wave velocity of an outbreak  
Version: 0.1  
Authors: Kathryn Morrison, Kate Zinszer  
Maintainer: Kathryn Morrison <kt.morrison@mail.mcgill.ca>  
Description: Estimates front-wave velocity of an outbreaking or emerging infectious disease. As inputs, only spatial coordinates and dates of first case are required. Users specify the desired or maximum order of the linear model used to interpolate the timing of the disease across the geographic area, and that model is used to estimate the rate and direction of disease spread.
